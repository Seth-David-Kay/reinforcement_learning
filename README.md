# Reinforcement Learning from Scratch for 2D Platforming

Development of a neural network capable of learning and traversing 2D platform maps using reinforcement learning built completely from scratch (including all of the algorithms).

## Current State

- The neural network can learn and navigate a known 2D platform map.

## Future State

- Currently working towareds a neural network that can regonize a new map and be able to traverse it on the first try.
  - Enhance generalization and adaptibility.
  - Enable adaptions to new map types/structures.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the initial training script to see the neural network learn a sample map.

## Usage \*needs updating\*
- Current flow:
  1. train_model_it()
  2. train_model_next_gen()
  3. best_moves_guiish()
  7. simulations.cli_input_simulate_run()
